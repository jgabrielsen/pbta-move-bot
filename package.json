Based on the [Command Handling section of the Discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/command-handling.html). No fancy features or character sheets or dice rollers; you probably already have those if you need them. I just wanted a way to quickly reference moves and rules without breaking the flow of a hybrid video session / play-by-post Dungeon World game.",
